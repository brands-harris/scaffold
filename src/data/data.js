//================================================================
//Keeping all your data functions in one place keeps your code DRY
//================================================================

//Don't forget to import your store and your actions.
//Without that you can't manipulate your state

//import store from '../store/store';
//import {ACTION_TYPE} from '../actions/actions';

var Data = {};

//Data.functionName = (param, param) => {};

export default Data;
